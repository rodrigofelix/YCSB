BenchXtend - based on Yahoo! Cloud System Benchmark (YCSB)
====================================

BenchXtend is a tool that extends YCSB to include the following features:
- Variation of clients during workload execution according to a pre-defined timeline
- Calculation of elasticity metrics of database systems in cloud, both in under and overprovisioning scenarios

For information about the regular YCSB take a look at https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the latest release of BenchXtend.

2. Set up a database to benchmark. There is a README file under each binding
   directory.

3. Run YCSB command, but with BenchXtend features:

    bin/ycsb load basic -P workloads/workloada
    bin/ycsb run basic -P workloads/workloada -timeline timeline.xml -sla sla.xml

   timeline.xml file: formatted to list the number of expected clients in each 
   of the workload execution. This way, it is possible to vary the number of clients 
   in a way that fits better to a specific application environment.
    
   sla.xml: defines the expected time for each operation (read, update, ...). It 
   establishes, theoretically, the agreement between a service provider and a 
   service consumer. 
   
   See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload
   for a detailed documentation on how to run a workload.

   See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties for 
   the list of available workload properties.
